# read_files_for_GPT
This is a GUI that reads all the code and structure from a specified folder to be used as input for GPT. 
It references the .gitignore file to ignore any specified files when reading the folder. 
The primary purpose of this tool is to input code into GPT when making queries, and it is also efficient for tasks such as requesting the creation of a README file.
